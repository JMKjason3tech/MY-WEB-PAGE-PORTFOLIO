#MY BASIC WEB-PAGE PORTFOLIO

This project is about my simple web-page portfolio that i created using visual studio code, containing HTML code and inline CSS.

It displays my:
*Work Experience
*Education background
*Technical skills (The common languages that i use to code) - simple explanations about those common programming languages

This web-page portfolio is just a beginner starting point, showing how one can just use HTML and a little bit of CSS to deploy a simple web-page as
a practical implementation of web development.
